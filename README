This is one of five colorschemes that were made with Base16 Builder. For the construction of these colorschemes, Solarized colorscheme stood as a model. Like in Solarized, the colorschemes come in a light  and in a dark background version. Its really just variations on the same idea, but each with its own color-value relations, interdependent on each other and their base (background-)color.  

One can find the demopage for these colorschemes at:
